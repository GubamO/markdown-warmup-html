    <h3>Me in a nutshell</h3>
    <p class="p1">Passionate about music of all kinds, I really like to spend my life listening to it, I spend most of my time in my home studio doing that as well as learning audio mixing <br> besides that I'm mostly time behind my screens since I have been a computer and new technology enthusiast since my childhood</p>
    
    <p>Moi, simplement </p>

                <h3>You can always count on me when ! </h3>

                <p>I usually like to find the answer myself, so I spend a lot of time researching alone and I can rack my brains for a long time on a small problem,<br> so if you too have been stuck for a while, come see me to find out. 'we can combine our research, we will necessarily find the solution together!</p>
            
                <h3>A funny story</h3>
                i once found myself reluctantly on the zap of spion when i was a kid via a video of me around 10-11 years old rapping on webcammax <br> with an awful headset and very short hair in gel filled spikes infamous.
